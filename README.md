Artemis Financial was a Finance consultant company who created financial plans for savings,retirements,investments,and insuracne for its clientelle.    Artemis wanted me to checkout any and all security vulnerabilities within their software and address them with a solution.  Specifically they wanted a file verification step within their web application which would take place in a checksum.  The software vulnerabilities were taken account for by performing dependency checks which would there on find vulnerabilities within the system and it's code.  Secure code can refrain from a potential threatening user finding a backdoor/loophole in a software.  Software security can retain a companies ability to protect personal information of any/all clients.  The most challenging part of weeding through vulnerabilities was the sheer amount of information brought to attention.  Approaching additional layers of security took time and patience.  By successfully running the code with no errors/bugs was my means of determining successful refactoring of code.   Rechecking the dependency report after the implementation of refactoring allowed for checking the code one last time.   I would demonstrate this last assignment as proof of my ability to secure a web application.
